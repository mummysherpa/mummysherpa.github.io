We decided it's time to take Pixie for a hike and we ended up choosing a quite difficult one. 

From Bar sur Loup up to Gourdon.

A friend told us that once he managed to complete the track in 45 minutes so we thought that we could easily do it in 1.5hours with a baby in the carrier. 

The first part of the hike is easy no elevation, I wanted to save some energy so wasn't rushing, the track is called Route de Paradis, a nice walk in the woods.
Quite early I noticed a few building on the top of a peak far far away, I was wondering what town could it be and my hubby pointed out, laughing, that that's our destination, we were hiking up to that peak far far away.

When you are sort of under Gourdon there is a sign, and you have to keep left, and yes, here comes the hard part. Its a path full of twists and turns leading up to the top. The sign indicated a 1 hour 10 minutes hike and thanks to hubby I managed! 
Pixie helped a lot, she fell asleep in the beginning so I didn't have to entertain her on the way up.

The view is very nice, all the cliffs and the sea in the background makes it one if the nicest hike if the region.

I think half way I started thinking that it was too big of a challenge for the first hike of the season. 

My hubby chose a new strategy to help me, he counted our steps and we took a break after every 150 steps. 
It doesn't seem a lot but believe me, for me, carrying Pixie it seemed huge taking 150 steps without stoping.

The relive came when looking up I spotted the viewpoint of Gourdon and I knew we were close, and yes, it was just a few more stops and we reach the top.

By the time we got into the town Pixie was up and she was as happy as me that the hike was over, I could rest and she could come out of the carrier and run around.

After eating lunch and had enough of the amazing view, we headed back.
The way down is easy although you have to pay attention because there are quite a few rocks on surface, for some I guess coming down is more difficult and for me quite challenging since I carry Pixie in my front so I cannot see my feet.

After the hike we just popped into the small town on Bar sur Loup, quite small charming village, but decided that our journey cannot end without going into Pont de Loup as well to visit the Florian factory to tase some sweets and chocolate.
