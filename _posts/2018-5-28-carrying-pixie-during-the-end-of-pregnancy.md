I consider myself lucky! Pregnancy is not an easy thing and sometimes it doesn't depend on you, even if you are an active and strong person sometimes you are not allowed to lift anything.

I couldn't continue using our [ergo baby](/blog/2018/03/18/we-got-a-new-ergobaby), the belt buckle wasn't comfortable after the 5th - 6th months. So I opted for the [ombu](/blog/2018/03/13/mummy-sherpa-got-a-new-carrier), it took some time to get used to and I'd definitely recommend starting using it at the early stage of the pregnancy. Even if you used to carrying you use different muscles in your back with this type of carrier and it will be hard for a few days. For me, I think it took around two or three weeks to train my back. And even now, at 38-weeks pregnant, I can carry Pixie on my back without any issues. 

She got used to walking with me, I'm very proud of her. For a long time, she was willing to walk hours with her nanny but she wanted me to carry her. I always have my ombu on my back when we leave the house and when she gets tired and says 'on back' I can just put her in the carrier and continue our walk.

She is getting more and more independent but she likes to be carried and wants to be close to me.

If you feel good while carrying your toddler you don't have to stop during your pregnancy. Your body will tell you if it's too much. But be prepared that you might need to find a new carrier or use your wrap in a different style.
