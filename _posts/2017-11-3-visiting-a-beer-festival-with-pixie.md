Families want to go out as well and sometimes we need some entertainment and not just parks, playdates and cartoons."

A few towns in the area organise their own beer festival in this time of the year.
We chose the Mougin's beer festival since it seemed the most family friendly. Gates open already at 11, you could go and have a lunch while listening to a live concert and try out different types of beer.
We just headed there in the afternoon so Pixie could have her nap in the car the way over. Since she just fell asleep a few minutes before we arrived I stayed in the car with her and let her sleep a bit more.

There were different types of draught beer, IPA, pale ale, wheat, amber. And a lot's of different food trucks, Asian, burgers, seafood. We ended up having a burger from one of my favourite local trucks, the Mother Trucker. Their burger is delicious, they never disappoint! Even Pixie tried it but she prefers the french fries. 

It was organised at the eco-park which is a very nice playground, all toys are made of wood and are very original. Pixie had so much fun there! We even found one where we could all sit and play with Pixie!

You'd think that a beer festival is not for kids but it is not necessarily true, she likes music, food, ok Pixie didn't get why she wasn't allowed to try our beers but we could have fun as a family!
