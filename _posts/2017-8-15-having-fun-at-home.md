Although if you have a toddler you'd like to avoid leaving the house from 11 till 2, or even leaving at all. Being surrounded by the sea is very tempting but you cannot control a toddler in the crowd, or at least I can't. She is not afraid at all, she doesn't mind strangers so she ends up running up and down in the crowd, me trying to follow her, and since she is so little, people sometimes don't even notice her so I try to protect Pixie from people bumping into her, or the other way around. 

So whenever it is just the two of us, I tend to stay at home. This means we had to find new activities.

The best investment this summer was a blow up pool, to call it a pool is a bit overstatement, it is just a little 1 meter pool but it is perfect for Pixie. I just filled it up with a few liters of water and the fun began. She liked her new toy, playing with the water and her plastic balls.

Of course, she is a princess, so as soon as she lied down she got her hair wet so we had to get out from the water. It's not fun at all for a princess to get truly wet in a pool during summer! 

We are lucky having a small terrace, so I have space for these toys but honestly, you can do it in the living room as well, just fill the pool with less water and the kids can have fun!
