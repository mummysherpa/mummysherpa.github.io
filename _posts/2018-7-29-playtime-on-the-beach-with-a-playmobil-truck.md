I got selected on a great French site, [MAM'Advisor](https://mamadvisor.magicmaman.com/) to test a [Playmobil Truck](https://amzn.to/2KadXq6).

Although Pixie loves to dress up in pink one of her first words was Camion (truck in French and Hungarian). She wants to stop at every construction site to check out the cool machines, and whenever she spots a truck she starts shouting truck, truck, truck!  I loved this present! It is perfect for Pixie and I was sure she will have lots of fun with it!

I was right! It's a great toy, you can play with it at home as well but it's perfect for the beach! It has a removable bucket and a sand sieve. They are perfect to build sand castles, fill the bucket with water or sand, and the two tracks that come with the truck to help it to navigate on the rough surface. It is part of the Playmobil sand collection but Pixie had a great time with it on our pebble beach as well. She filled the truck with rocks and water and the big wheels could manage that surface as well!

It's a perfect toy for 2 years olds! And I guess for older kids as well! Not too complicated, lot's of possibilities to play with it at home, the beach or at the park. It's light, so mum won't have a hard time carrying it, easy to clean. It's just perfect!

Pixie had so much fun on the beach and at least this time she didn't want to steal other kids' toys!
