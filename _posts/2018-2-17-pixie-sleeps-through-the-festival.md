We went there after swim class which might not have been the best idea, or it might have been, since she slept through the whole thing. But it gave us enough time to see all the vendors, taste some wine, cheese, chocolate and our favourite Hungarian cake, Kürtős kalács!

It's not a big festival, but it's in our home town and if you live close enough it's definitely worth to check it out.

I'm sure Pixie would have loved to run around and taste the cheese and especially the chocolate, but you cannot control a toddler and her sleep. Of course we bought some delicious stuff so she can try them at home.

We also entered into a giveaway, yes we love competitions.

Thank you for the help!
