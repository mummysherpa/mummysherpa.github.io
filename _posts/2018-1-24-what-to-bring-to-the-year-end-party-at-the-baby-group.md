No wonder if there is a baby party there are two type of parents, half of them bring something to drink, and it's not always something healthy, or they bring sweets. So whenever I have to bring something I opt for the savoury option.

A few months ago an easy recipe popped up on my Facebook feed, and I thought I would give it a try. And surprise-surprise although there were lots of sweets. kids also ate my savoury tart.

It's puff pastry with pesto. You just unroll the pastry, spread the pesto, lay the second puff pastry on the top, and with a knife create stripes, and twist them, brush it with egg yolk. Put it in the oven for 40 minutes and it's ready! Nice and easy! And although it's green kids love it!

Here is the before and after picture. Even if Pixie needs attention I have enough time to prepare this at home!
