We have lots of Easter traditions in Hungary and I'm very glad that the egg hunt is something French people like to do as well.

There are quite a few ones organised on the Riviera but this year it was hard to find one in Antibes. We were very lucky! I saw an advertisement about one organised in Villa Verde, in the home and garden supply store, my husband went to sign up that afternoon and he managed to get one of the few last available places for Pixie.

I already put a reminder in my calendar for next year to check with the shop if they organise it again.

It took place early afternoon, so we told Pixie that she had to take her nap early because when she'd wake up we were going on a surprise adventure. She understood it and was happy to take an earlier nap and when we woke her up we told her that we had to get ready quickly to leave for the adventure. She was so excited and curious! I'm always surprised to see how much she can actually understand! She doesn't say much but when you explain something to her, she listens and understands it. I thought it will be hard to put her to bad or to wake her up earlier, but no, she knew that we had to leave for her adventure.

When we arrived we still had time until the start so we went to see the animals. I think Pixie enjoyed seeing real live rabbits and not just toy ones and the ones in her books. She was running around in the shop very excited. She also enjoyed seeing all the little fishes in their luminescent aquariums.

Before the start, we tried to explain to her that there will be hidden wooden eggs in the garden and she needs to find 10 and put them in her bag. She didn't really get it until we found the first hidden eggs end showed them to her. She was very glad to collect them in her little bag. The hunt took around half an hour, it was easy to find 10 eggs but we stayed to search for the special golden eggs for the extra prize. She definitely needed our help with the hunt, I guess next year, at the age of 3 this will be more adapted for her but it was a great experience!

Pixie enjoyed being among all the plants and running around. She even found a cat and we were chasing him for quite a while.

At the end, we exchanged the wooden eggs for some chocolate ones. She was so eager to eat them all, but we told her we will open the bag when we go home and she can have some but not all of them at the same time. We were asking her if she would share it with us, she kept saying 'mummy no', 'daddy no'. When we got home and opened the bag she gave the first two to us! It's always a great feeling when she is generous and shares things with us!

I was so glad that we took her to this egg hunt and it was a great experience for her as well!
