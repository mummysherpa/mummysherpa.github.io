Last year we only took her to the sea a couple of times but it seemed promising. During the first time she fall asleep in the arms of my husband. Not sure if the waves and the cold water was scary for her or relaxing but she seemed rather peaceful. I imagined her having fun in the sea this year but my dreams failed.

Even in the swimming pool she is still not comfortable going under water. But she has a lot of fun with the inflatable toys. For those kids who are already capable of walking steadily there are some inflatable castle like things or a long carpet on the top of the water where they can round up and down. She had a few scares on the slide but now she climbs on top and enjoys sliding down in the water. Given, of course, we catch her. She loves the small pool for kids where she can run around and play with the water fountains.

Every time before we leave I try to teach her how to go under water but as soon as her face is wet she starts screaming. I guess my little princess doesn't like being under water.

Now we tried the beach a few times but getting in the water is a disaster. Even if we are just sitting by the sea and wait for the waves to reach us she cannot calm down. So for now we gave up trying and having fun with her on the shore. She loves running around, collecting pebbles, taking of my sunglasses trying them on, evidently she refuses her own sunglasses. We end up having a wonderful time on the beach and keep hoping that by next year she will enjoy the water as well.
