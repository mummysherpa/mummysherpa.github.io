I'm expecting our second little cheeky monkey.

I'm currently in my 25th week, doing good now. 

It was hard during the first trimester, being sick and having a very energetic toddler. Now it's the good part of the pregnancy, I'm much better and Pixie starts to get used to me not being able to lift her up all the time. 

My only issue when my bump started to get bigger was our carrier. It wasn't comfortable anymore and I felt a pressure on my belly.

So I looked into our options. I definitely wanted to keep carrying Pixie and since most of the time, we take the public transportation to town I wanted a carrier that I can take on and off easily. Using a wrap and carrying Pixie on my back and tying the wrap with a nice finish above my belly would have been an option but Pixie wants to get on and off so often I wanted something quicker. 
I ended up choosing an onbuhimo carrier which doesn't have a waist strap. Just two shoulder straps.

I got a very nice design which I love!

It's from the Natibaby Circus Parade wrap, handmade by [Sweetberry](https://www.sweetberry.hu/en/).

It's easy to use, although requires a bit of practice. It's not that easy to put on a very wriggling toddler on your back, but you can learn! But it is super easy to take her off if she wants to run around.

I thought since I carried her every day my back and shoulders will be strong enough for the onbu which unfortunately wasn't true. But now after using it for months, I'm getting stronger and can carry Pixie for longer periods. In the beginning, an hour was the maximum and I felt like I would have exercised much longer.

Pixie really likes this new carrier. Whenever she wants to go out she just takes it out from the box and brings it to me. She knows that I will carry her in this one now, and the other one is for my husband.

If you are expecting your second baby you don't have to give up babywearing. If you have enough practice and everything is fine with your pregnancy you can keep carrying. Just look out for the signs, your body will let you know if it is too much.
