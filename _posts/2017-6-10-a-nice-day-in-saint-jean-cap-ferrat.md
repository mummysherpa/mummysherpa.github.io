title: "A nice day in Sain Jean Cap Ferrat"

header: "We've never done the tour around Saint Jean Cap Ferrat and decided that after a challenging hike to Gourdon we needed something nice and relaxing. 
But do not think for a second that for us it would be a day on a beach or staying home. For us nice and relaxing is a 16 km long walk around a picturesque peninsula with a costal path and nice beaches.
We took an early train to Beaulieu-Sur-Mer. Ever since Pixie learned walking even an easy train ride can be challenging, she refuses to sit and it takes both of us and a lot of energy to entertain her.

After we got of from the train in a few minutes we found the sign indicating the way towards the peninsula. 

I was very curious to see another costal tour after our own Cap D'Antibes one.

The first bit of the tour takes you in the center of Saint Jean Cap Ferrat, it is a nice pedestrian walkway. When you get in the town keep left and go to the beach where the actual costal path starts, from here on you will find some information points about the track.

After a while you could go up to sea a nice little church with an unusual gigantic statue. Although the road leading up is not so nice I'd recommend visiting the church. 

At the end of the first bit there is a small lovely beach, if walking was enough for you, you can head back to the center but we decided to continue.
Along the way you can check out a few modern villas and envy their amazing views.

We stopped for a couple of minutes to let Pixie walk a bit. She wasn't enjoying the carrier as she used to, but can understand her. It is much better to run around and examine every bit of her surrounding.

The tour around the peninsula is a typical costal path with a few steps and rocks but it is well maintained and not a difficult walk, if you can walk a few kilometers. 

When we reached the end we decided to finish the day at Villefranche-sur-Mer. 
Unfortunately the nice walkway finishes here and there isn't always separate pedestrian walkway but the road is not too busy.
The beach in Villefranche seemed very crowded for us, not surprising, so we just stopped at a bench and let Pixie run around.
We had a nice long walk and she needed to loose some energy as well!
