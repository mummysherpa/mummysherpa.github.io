My husband was lucky and won a breakfast invitation to one of the bars in our town. Yes, we love to participate in different competitions, we usually choose them wisely. We pick the ones with only a few participants to have a bigger chance of winning. This time we won on Instagram a breakfast from the [Key West bar](https://www.facebook.com/keywestantibes/) in the old town.

We haven't really gone to cafés with Pixie. She never was the kid who liked to sit patiently and quietly for more than a few minutes. Recently she fell in love with her pram. She keeps seeing kids in them and wants to use hers as well. I still find babywearing more practical but this time a pram made more sense. Since she loves it, even the fact that we are going on a trip with our pram is exciting for her. And it keeps her distracted for a time. 

We just chose a table at the café where Pixie was able to stay in the pram, she loved the idea of sitting with us at the table meanwhile staying in her own 'chair'.

She distracted herself with all the menus of the café while we managed to choose our breakfasts. We never eat this much usually but we wanted something filling for an early brunch. 

And of course, pancakes were a must!

Everything was perfect! I wanted some sort of sweet as well so I chose a hot chocolate with whipped cream, and it was the best choice! It was huge and just as sweet as I like it.

To our surprise, Pixie ate a lot as well. She ate half of our pancakes, who could blame her, she ate a lot from our eggs and of course, my hot chocolate had to be shared with her. I guess she would be happy to go to a café every morning and have a treat like this.

I think we spent there almost an hour, we just enjoyed our family time and a slow breakfast. But an hour was Pixie's limit. She wanted to get out and run around. When it was obvious we had to leave we asked her if she wanted to have a little walk, and obviously, she was happy to! We went to the beach where she could run around freely.

It was a perfect relaxing morning! And we had an amazing breakfast!
