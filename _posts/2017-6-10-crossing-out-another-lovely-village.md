So now, when we only went up to the Gokart court we had enough time to walk around and explore the village.

It is a very lovely small village, I enjoyed walking around its small cobblestone streets.
Pixie had fun as well we encountered quite a few cats who were very friendly and cuddly. 
There is even a poets walk in the village, there are numerous plaques on the walls with a little poem.  
And one of the best part, the view, it's amazing. You can see the hills of Esterel, Cap D'Antibes and the other little villages below the town.
You won't find any souvenir shops here, surprisingly we haven't even found a boulangerie. But it definitely worth a visit.
