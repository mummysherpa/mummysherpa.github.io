header: "Pixie started walking 3,5 months ago. She used to fall all the time, didn't pay attention at all. She didn't look down to the ground so wherever there was a small step or something in the way she ended up falling. Despite all these she was unstable, always wanting to run around and explore her new world."

Now she is very confident, Pixie wants to go everywhere von her own. Go? Walk? No! She runs! Yes, she is extremely quick, always running! No matter if the road is too steep for her, what could happen? Nothing bed since mummy should always follow her and catch her while falling. I need to pay extra attention, nothing can stop her!

All this means that she doesn't want to be in the carrier.

When we start to get ready to leave she gets very excited. She brings me her shoes and points to the door. The issue starts when I get our ergobaby out. I cannot get how fast Pixie changes. A few months ago she was dragging the carrier to the living room when she got bored at home and wanted to go outside.

Now the first few minutes when we leave and she has to go in the carrier are a pretty big challenge. She cries, gets frustrated, tries to get out. She is already in the tantrum phase, but I never expected that she will have issues with the carrier she used to love.

Of course, after a few minutes Pixie calms down, and she enjoys our walk down to the old town where I can take her out of the ergo baby and she can run around and enjoy her freedom.
