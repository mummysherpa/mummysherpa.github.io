I looked at pictures when I was pregnant with Pixie and I think my bump at 9th months was the same size as my current one at 7th months. Yes, my body is different now, my belly is more flexible since this is my second pregnancy, I knew all these stuff and it's not a real surprise, but still, when I look down on my huge bump I'm still surprised.

Everybody keeps asking me how do I feel. And I feel great! I know that I still have a few easy weeks before the end when everything starts to be more and more complicated. I decided that this would be a perfect time to get some pictures taken.

I was very fortunate! I was browsing Facebook when I saw an ad that a new photographer in the region was offering a free photo session just to expand his portfolio and Facebook page. I was lucky enough to be chosen and we fixed the date! [Here is a link to his site.](https://www.facebook.com/mantasbucnys/) 

I loved the photo shoot, this was my first time when I got my photos taken by a professional. I guess my husband was very glad as well because this way he didn't have to make the photos which should be a big relief for him and saved us a lot of time ðŸ™‚

The photographer was perfect, he is young, but he knows what he's doing. We ended up doing the photos in Nice and I asked him to make a few of them in the old town. I really like the atmosphere of its little streets.

We walked around a bit and he made a few photos at different locations that we both liked, by the end, I think we tried 9 different locations which are a lot I guess, but everything is so nice in Nice! The photographer was a big help for me, he made me laugh, gave me good instructions where to look, how to stand. It was a great experience!

He sent me the photos a few days after the shoot and I loved them!

I'm so glad I had the chance to get my pictures taken and I will be able to look at these pictures and remember how special was this time of my pregnancy.
