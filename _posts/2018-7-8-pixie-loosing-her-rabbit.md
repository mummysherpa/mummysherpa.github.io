header: "Pixie was never attached to toys until a few months ago. She prefered some over others but never searched for a particular one. She got attached to her donkey she got in the hospital. She learnt the sound of a donkey and kept repeating it if she wanted to play with it."

Her other favourite became a rabbit she got as a present after Easter. Same as with the donkey, she imitated the sound of a rabbit when searching for it or talking about her toy. She wanted to take them with us when we went out, and to my surprise, she kept good care of them.

One weekend we went out for a long walk and Pixie insisted on bringing the rabbit. On the way to the old town, I kept asking her to show me the rabbit, to make sure she was still holding it. And she was. The rabbit was in her hand all the time never felt down, she was playing with it and having so much fun.

On our way back I know she had it in the beginning, and I kept looking at it for a while but at some point, I forgot about it and haven't asked her for a longer period. When we were almost home I noticed that the rabbit was gone... I tried to ask her about it, but she was surprised and sad as well because the rabbit was gone.

My husband went back the same route but haven't found it.

Pixie was asking about the rabbit and I tried to explain that daddy couldn't find it, the rabbit went on an adventure. But she was so sad we went back again but had no luck.

For a few days, she was telling something about the rabbit with a very sad face. I already posted in a few local Facebook groups that we lost our precious bunny, but no luck there.

So what can you do? You try to replace it.

I searched online for hours. Found a shop that still sells the same ones but they are in Switzerland and they don't deliver to France. I wrote a heartfelt letter to them  I only got a reply a few days later that they transferred my letter to the appropriate department but they never got back to me.

I asked for the help of an awesome Facebook mum's group and someone found on [leboincoin](https://www.leboncoin.fr/), an online site where you can sell your used items. With that idea, I continued my search there and found another one as well. I wrote to both of them and luckily one was still available.
So what can you do, you buy it of course!

When the package arrived I told Pixie that the bunny came back from his trip and we are going to pick him up.

She was so excited. The rabbit arrived in a box, but you could see on Pixie's face that she knows what was inside.

We walked back home to open the box, and you can see how happy she was!

It might be only a toy, and she has so many others, I have to add I don't buy them for her, she gets it as presents from family and friends, but this bunny means something to her.

I still think it was a great idea to replace the lost toy. I know some parents who try to be proactive and buy more from the same toy so if something like this happens they are prepared. One shop, Monoprix, also offers a service where you can register your toy you bought in there shop and if something happens they will replace it.

According to my husband, you should be able to explain to a child that the toy is lost, but I'm not sure that's always the case.

Anyhow, now we have our bunny back from his adventure and I'll be much more careful when we go out with him if he will be even allowed to leave the house!
