She likes airplanes, and always looks up and tries to find them if she hears their noise. But yes, it only keeps her entertained for a few seconds, and watching planes for an hour or so it's not that fun for her.

This time our outing was for me! I love the air race, I think it looks cool, the pilots are doing an amazing job and it's something unique. I always went to see it at Budapest and now that it came to Cannes I couldn't resist.
Although it had an amazing view and planes flying in the bay of Cannes looks great but at Budapest, they fly below the Chain bridge which I find more exciting.

We only went for the training part, I thought there will be fewer people so would be easier with Pixie, and I was right. You definitely need a ticket to have a great view because they put up walls around the fan zone, but if you know the Croisette well you know a few spots where you can get to a bit higher ground and from there the view was nice as well. It was easy to get a spot there on the training day but I guess it was pretty full during the race day.

I took the bus to get to Cannes, and Pixie was asleep during the entire way there. It was great because she didn't get a long nap, yes, selfish mummy woke her up to go see some planes. By the time we reached Cannes so was well rested and she was ready to walk! I just took her out from the onbuhimo and she was eager to walk! She was so excited in the crowd, luckily Pixie is not afraid among lots of people she rather finds it entertaining.

I haven't bought a ticket in advance since I wasn't sure I'd be able to attend, and unfortunately the tickets for that they were already sold out. So we walked around and found us a nice spot at the top of some stairs. It was ideal for us with good views of the bay and comfy option to sit down. 

Pixie was very happy because I brought along her bunny backpack, and she was playing happily with it. After a while, we sat down because Pixie wanted to eat her crackers, and I cannot really feed her, make sure she doesn't run away, hold all our stuff, and not spill out the food. I was well prepared! I know that when she wakes up from her nap she is always hungry and wants to eat something. I rather have her favourite healthy snacks with me than having to search for something in a shop that she would like and not crazy expensive (or not made of chocolate).

She was interested in the planes for a couple of minutes but after a while, she had enough. The bunny kept her entertained for some extra time but when she got restless we continued our walk and headed home.

I know it might not have been the best event for her, but sometimes mummy wants to see something. And it's fine. She had a great time, and for her, it doesn't really matter where we are until she is having fun with me!

If your toddler is bigger and interested in planes this is a great event! I'd recommend it to anyone but make sure to buy a ticket if you want to go on a race day!
