I carry Pixie in a buckle carrier so we can get around easy but when you have to check out a lower shelf or you are surrounded by fragile products it can be quite difficult.

I only wanted to do some clothes shopping but asked by husband to come with us and have some fun. So we headed to the nearest shopping center and we were curious to see how adapted is the place for toddlers.

__What to do at Polygon Riviera__

When we arrived at the underground parking we saw a sign for the family parking space, but they only had one available out of the total 18, so we choose a closer spot near the exit. I wouldn't try to find that spot for an extra few centimeters but if you have to get out the car seat, stroller or help a toddler to get in,  it can be useful.

The place is quite nice, some water fountains surrounded by small trees. If you can control your toddler, they can run around, but Pixie is too small to listen so we do not dear to let her go in the crowd.

They have a nice courtyard for kids. There is a small carousel you can turn manually, which is a nice surprise since they are very popular here, almost every town has one, or more and kids insist on going on them and obviously one ride is never enough. So you end up spending quite a lot on them. But not here, kids just need their dads to push the carousel round and round. 
Pixie also enjoyed playing with the fountains. Luckily during the summer it is not an issue if her clothes get wet. She loves when the water goes higher or stops suddenly, she always gets surprised.

There are also 2 cool swings and a photo board to occupy the little ones.

The center also has a nursery where you can leave kids, who are over 2 years old, for an hour for free, while you do your shopping, or just enjoy your coffee. Or they have a soft play area with a few toys, kid's table, pool filled with plastic balls. You can leave your husband here with the kids. I guess they would enjoy this more than going from one shop to an other.

We managed to do some shopping and Pixie had an amazing time at the courtyard. I'd even go back to play with her there and not to do any shopping.
