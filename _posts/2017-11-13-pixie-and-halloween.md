We both dressed up as geishas, she only had a nice yukata on and some safety proof straws in her hair. (My husband was too afraid of her running around and falling with some real chops sticks in her hair so I had to be creative) I put on my kimono, obi, painted my face and put up my hair with some nice decorative chops sticks."

We meet up with a few friends with bigger kids and visited the shops in the old town of Antibes. They were well prepared! There were lots of dressed up kids running around and most of the shops still had candies left to offer.
It was a good idea to go with a group of kids, Pixie was copying them and she was showing me that she wants to go into the shops with them.

Pixie gave up walking pretty fast so I put her in the carrier, but she was very excited. She was holding her little bag and was so happy when she received some new candies and wanted to try them immediately. Luckily she didn't get a sugar overdose because she didn't like any of the candy, she only received one biscuit that she was happy to eat.

Trick or treating wasn't a big thing here a few years ago but nowadays it is very popular. The entire old town was full of kids, the shops were prepared a few of them even offered free face painting and other activities for the kids.

When we go home I showed Pixie the Jack-o'-lantern I made, she considered it as a toy and was playing with it. Also, she tried to use it as a chair, to be honest, it was the perfect size for her, a little baby puff chair. I'm still afraid to put a real candle in the pumpkin so I put my phone in there and switched on the flashlight. Pixie was intrigued by the lit up pumpkin. I hope next year she will be able to help me to carve it.

We stayed in our costumes and waited for the trick or treaters, a few kids came and they where happy that we waited for them dressed up. Although Pixie wasn't as happy passing out candies as receiving them. She was very curious every time to see who was banging on our door.

Considering that she is only 20 months old I think she had fun during Halloween. If you want to dress up with your kid I think it's a good age to start, just don't expect too much, be ready to leave if she is tired and go out with a bigger group so she would be able to see the other kids.
