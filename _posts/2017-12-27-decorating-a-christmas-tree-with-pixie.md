But for me, it's perfect as Pixie makes it! She was so cute helping!

She loves boxes, so it was a special treat for her that all of our decoration is kept in boxes, she loved unpacking them! After we showed her how to hang the ornaments she was trying to do it by herself with more or less success! She had a good time! Especially when I held her high, so she could put a few more ornaments on higher branches.

She even redecorates the tree when she wants to play with it, currently, I have a branch with 5 balls and 2 stars. It's not a symmetrical decoration, but who wants it to be?

It was a very special Christmas this year when Pixie was able to participate! Last year she was curious about the tree but didn't really cared for it, but it was different this year! Although I didn't take out the fragile ornaments, maybe next year!

Don't be afraid to let your kids have fun! It is something they can take part in and enjoy it with you! Given that the tree is standing steadily in its base :)
