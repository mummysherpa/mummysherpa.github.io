title: "Getting Pixie ready in the morning"

Now we have to take the bus, so we need to leave on time. And believe me, for Pixie it's not easy. She gets distracted very easily, especially if she sees her toys.

I try to get everything ready by the time she wakes up. There are just limited amount I can do, it depends on her. She eats herself and she doesn't let me help her. And I'm so proud of her, she can eat her yogurt by herself with a spoon and she doesn't make a mess. Sometimes she is so hungry and focused that she finishes her breakfast in a few minutes but there are those days when she plays with her food and it takes ages.

To gain some time, sometimes I even do her hair while she is eating. I don't want to wake her up earlier. I just feel that our morning routine would just get longer and longer, she would get used to having more time and would demand more â˜º 
But there is no way to rush Pixie. Just mummy has to be quicker in the other tasks.

Her bag is as prepared as can be, just have to get out her lunch from the fridge when we leave. Her clothes are laid out, shoes and coat by the door.
It's just getting our morning cuddle and breastfeed finished in time. But who would want to rush a morning cuddle with a cute little one?

I definitely need more practice to leave the house in time but that's normal. Nothing is easy with a toddler.
