The week, when Pixie was born, was a busy week at the hospital, some of her friends were born at the same place just a few days apart. This year just a few weeks after she turned she was invited to a birthday party. I was very curious to see how it would turn out since I decided not to throw a party for Pixie and have just a family celebration.

It was a late morning party, I guess the best time with little ones. At this age they no longer have a morning nap, they are active and well rested and you still have time after the party to get home for the afternoon siesta.
Unfortunately, the weather was very bad and the party was inside the house, I bet the kids would have been eager to run around the garden but they had to burn their energy inside the house. And yes, there was a lot's of running around even without the sugar rush from the cakes.

Luckily the snacks were put on a higher table so the kids couldn't see them that much besides Pixie was focused on all the new toys she could try out. There was plenty of space for the little ones to play, I guess our flat is not big enough for a bunch of kids, I cannot imagine how I would be able to fit this many kids plus their parents into our apartment. I guess we'll need to organise parties outside or have more intimate ones with just a few of Pixie's friends.

The host family has more kids so they are already used to sharing their toys. Nobody had any issues playing nicely with each other. This was one of my fears. Pixie is still so attached to her belongings I couldn't imagine how she would react when other kids would play with her stuff.

It was a party to celebrate the kids second birthday but there were bigger kids as well who were very nice to the little ones, I think it is always easier to play together when the bigger ones can show a nice example and they usually understand that the smaller ones are sometimes difficult and they need to be flexible with them.

It was just a nice playground for all of them without many organised activities, kids just had fun doing what they wanted. They explored the toys, run around, ate some snacks. There was one organised game where all the kids joined in after Pixie saw them sitting in a circle she wanted to join as well on her own, it was the  Pass the Parcel game. They were so happy unwrapping the present and finding some gummy bears hidden between the layers of wraps. And surprise, Pixie was the one who unwrapped the last layer and she won a small playdough set. She was so happy. She didn't really get what was going on, but she loves tearing apart paper, so the unwrapping part was easy for her and she got so excited when she saw a present underneath it. 

All the kids gathered around to when they brought in the cakes, yes when you have multiple birthday kids, you have more than one cake as well :), they were so excited to see the cakes. There was plenty for everyone, and of course, Pixie having a sweet tooth and being very curious she wanted to try all three of them. We stayed a bit more so Pixie would be able to play with the kids, she was in her element and had so much fun! 
But we knew that we had to leave because it was already her naptime and she can be very difficult when she is overtired. I played with her in the car to keep her awake until we got home. If she falls asleep in the car there is a big chance that the car ride is her only nap which could lead to disasters.

It was a very nice party, and I was so glad we were invited. It showed me that you can organise a fun celebration for little ones as well, just don't be afraid to organise one!
