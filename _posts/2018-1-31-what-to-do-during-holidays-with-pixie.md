header: "As soon as schools shut down for the holidays all of the playgroups close as well. Even our favourite baby-friendly cafe was closed for a week. Which is understandable, people close their business to spend time with their family, but my very active Pixie wants to leave the house and go play somewhere."

Our town, Antibes, organised lots of activities for kids. They opened an ice skate rink which was free for the little ones. I was thinking about trying it with Pixie but wherever we went there, there were too many people and I was afraid that Pixie would need somewhat more quite and calm environment to try skating.. ok I wasn't exactly thinking she would skate, but they had a few push toys so I was thinking about just pushing her around the rink, but I didn't want to go with the crowd. But next year it will be perfect for Pixie.

There was also free arts and craft sessions organised almost all afternoon, this could be entertaining for bigger kids. Since Pixie loves to draw, but drawing mainly consist of scribbling all over the place (as much on the paper as on the table). Her age isn't appropriate yet for these sessions. I'm really looking forward next year when she will be able to enjoy all of these.

There was also a small little farm installed by the seaside. Kids could pet all different kinds of animals, rabbits, goats, donkeys, ponies, and others. Pixie preferred to watch them but was very happy to see again a cow! I expected her to like the cute little rabbits but apparently, she prefers cows â˜º

Pixie liked the Christmas market as well, especially the Hungarian stand where they were selling a special brioche. Yes, she has a sweet tooth and I think she would eat anything sweet.

Even if your little one is still small I recommend getting out for a walk in the town, they love all the lights and all the decorations. Pixie wanted to check out all the Christmas trees and Santa decorations.
