We'll visit the South first and then drive up to Lisbon! My husband put a lot of effort into organising everything, researching where to go, what to see. So the planning is done for now, we just have to get ready.

I think flying will be fine, Pixie didn't have any issues with flying so far, and now she even more curious and interested in her surroundings, so that part will be easy. And it's only a few hours flight, so not a big deal.

I'm more worried about her eating, we sort of have a routine at home, she doesn't have a big appetite and only eats certain things, which is fine here. But not sure what she'll be willing to eat during our trip.

She is usually fine with potatoes, rice, pasta and chicken, oh and scrambled eggs. She eats soup if there isn't anything in it... but I might be able to be creative and fish out all the little things from her soup. She also likes pastries and yoghurt, so in theory, it should be ok. But I guess it's normal for me to worry about these things.

The other question for me is sleeping, she has a longer nap every afternoon at home, and we haven't been away since she has this routine. She still can sleep in the carrier, but she usually has a short nap if I'm carrying her. Not sure how she'll behave when we are in the city all day, or driving around and she won't have a chance to have a 2-hour uninterrupted nap.

But we'll have to see. I want her to get used to going out again, it was so easy with her when she was little. So I'm hoping for the best!

Pixie was helping me during the weekend to pack, she loves putting things I give her in the suitcase, she sometimes likes to take them out as well, but I managed to convince her that they should stay in. I now know why things tend to take more time when done with toddlers :)

I still have to finish packing, but it's usually fine. I pack what's necessary plus a few additional items in case of accidents which can happen anytime with a kid. Her pop up bed, sleeping bag, and hopefully she won't notice that she is in a new environment if she wakes up for a second during the night. I always pack a few stuff in case she would get sick like paracetamol, thermometer, nose sucker. Kids catch a cold so easily, and I don't want to run around in different pharmacies to find the one thing I know would help her. Luckily we never needed these things, but they don't take up much space and I like to have them around.

I hope I'll have some time during the trip to update the blog with all the fun we have with Pixie!
