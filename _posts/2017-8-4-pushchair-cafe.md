We were looking forward to this opening since there weren't many places where we could go with kids. It was sort of OK until Pixie was little and she felt comfortable staying in the carrier or in my lap but now when she wants to run around and explore the world we could go to normal Cafes. There were 2 small ones in Antibes where they had a toy box for kids, but the space was too small for them to have fun.

We were very happy when this new cafe was announced and it turned out to be perfect!
There is a small corner for kids with a toy kitchen, small table some pillows books and lots of toys. And there is a higher playpen where even the babies can have fun.

The decoration is Alice in wonderland, there is even suspended door on the ceiling, I'm curios to know which magical world is on its other side.

The place is not crowded, to my surprise, but this means that we can always get the table next to the play area so the kids can entertain themselves and we, mummies, can hope for a few minutes of rest. 

Pixie loves pancakes and whenever another customer orders one she becomes obsessed and we always end up having one, not that I would complain. Since she is still not eating a lot, although getting better, we always share my food. They have different options for lunch as well and even offer food for the little ones. 

They even have a few workshops for kids, mums or soon to be mums. Like art, massage, dancing, singing. There is always something going on.

I plan to take Pixie to the art classes when she will be a bit older. For now we will stick with playing and having pancakes.
