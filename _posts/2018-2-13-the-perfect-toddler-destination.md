The flight and hotels' prices were too tempting not to take this trip, we were very curious to see how Pixie would react to the cold sea. We don't really go down to the beach during winter time at home. We should change this, it's beautiful but we usually do something different this time the year.

Pixie is used to the nice warm sea where she can swim and have fun. I thought that she might just run into the cold ocean no matter the weather, but NO! She is definitely a little princess, she doesn't like to get her clothes wet. So she was a perfect little girl running around the beach.

And why is it Algarve the perfect destination during January? Because the beaches are empty. We had most of them for ourselves so we could let Pixie go and run and have fun!
It was perfect! 

During summer time our beach is so crowded that I don't like to let her go and she is only allowed to play on our towel and come into the sea with us. But this time it was different! She was so happy to be free and she knows that she won't lose us, she could run away and turn back and see us clearly we weren't lost in the crowd.

She had so much fun exploring the rock formations, the caves, playing with the sand. She was in her element! It is a beautiful region, if you prefer nicer sandy beaches you can find them East from Faro but if you like unique rock formations, as I do, I recommend Western part.

We rented a car and went from Sagres til Tavira and explored the nicest beaches. We stayed in the middle, in Albufeira. Pixie enjoyed the car rides and every time we stopped she wanted to sit on my husband's lap and 'drive'. She was always saying Dady 'dudu' meaning that Dady is driving.

I can safely recommend a beach destination with a toddler during winter. They would love it!
