There was a small flower festival organised in Antibes and we thought we'd have a nice walk in the port, check out the flowers and have a stroll in the old town.

Pixie likes to look at the boats in the port, and I understand her. It looks great! 

Also, there are some electric locks on every gate and she loves to stop and push the buttons. I know she shouldn't push them, but she doesn't do any harm. Buttons are her soft spots. She always wants to push everything that has buttons, bank card readers, parking meters, phones...

She has already walked a lot by the time we got into the festival. The whole event lasts for a few weeks and takes place at multiple locations. I'd recommend it to everyone who likes nice gardens, during the festival they open up a few gardens, like the Rose garden in Villa Eilenroc which is normally closed to the public. 

We actually went to see a flower market.  The local florists and garden shops install next to the port and you can check out their products, smell some nice flowers, get some guidance what to choose if you want to get a few plants for your terrace. 

There were also a couple of animations for the kids. They could decorate pots, make flower bouquets from paper and actual flower as well. The only one adapted for Pixie's age was planting a flower, they were really nice to us and told us that she should definitely try it. The lady at the stand helped Pixie to fill her little pot with soil, put in the plant, put more soil on top and then water it. She was so excited to be involved! My husband had to hold her because the table was too high for her, but it didn't bother Pixie. She wanted to participate and she proudly showed off her creation. She knows that's her plant and so happy to water it.

Not to our surprise Pixie immediately picked out that there is a tasting stand where we could try out some local products like gingerbread and honey, and yes, she really wanted the gingerbread and she was 'demanding' a little piece. 

She is so cute when she wants to try out something. Although it is still unknown to me when is she willing to try something. If she sees a tasting stand she usually wants a piece but if I offer her something new at home she doesn't want it.

This time the gingerbread wasn't a success, I guess it's too spicy for her. We walked some more among the flowers and then continued our walk in the old town. My husband was a bit surprised how slow can we get to places when Pixie is walking. She is interested in everything and she wants to check out all the shop windows, wants to sit on every bench or just run around. Which is completely normal at her age. She is exploring the world. 

By the time we headed back, Pixie got so tired it was a bit difficult with her. She refused to be carried in our ErgoBaby, and we made the mistake letting her walk. In the last few minutes, my husband was carrying her in his arms because she couldn't continue the walk. Next time we won't let her decide, we knew she was tired but was so happy to walk so we let her. if we put her in the carrier when she refuses it she will have a small meltdown, but it only lasts for a minute and she will enjoy having a nap when she calmed down.

Now we try to offer her a choice carrier or walking, we are just experimenting to see what happens when she can decide. But we should have kept in mind that she walked more than an hour already and she was tired. Next time we'll let her decide something else. Like if she wants to go back by the port or by the old town while being in the carrier.

Not counting the last five minutes our outing was a success. She had so much fun and we spent a nice time together!
