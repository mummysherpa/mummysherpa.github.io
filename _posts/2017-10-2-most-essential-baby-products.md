title: "Most essential baby products"

header: "Since I'm a first time parent I bought some useless stuff for Pixie. It's very hard to decide what is really needed. The shops are full with essentials but you won't use most of them. Especially if you want to be prepared for everything and you think, as I did, that it is easier to buy all the baby products in advance rather than sending out the hubby shopping because you have to stay home with the baby."

I decided to write a series of posts of our favourite products which helped us and made our life easier at home or during trips.
