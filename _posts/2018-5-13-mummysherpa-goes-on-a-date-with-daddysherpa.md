Before baby °2 arrives we wanted to go out, just the two of us, since we know it just gets more difficult with two little ones.

We were the lucky winners of a photo competition and won an invitation to a Michelin Star restaurant in Antibes. We decided it's better and easier if my husband takes the afternoon off and go for a lunch date while Pixie is at her nanny.

A few years ago we already tried this restaurant when they had a buy one get two dinners offer during the offseason. We decided that we had everything we needed, and we choose this as each others Christmas present. It was fantastic, the food was delicious and exactly what you'd expect in a restaurant like this and the decoration, the setting, the atmosphere is very sophisticated but still very welcoming. 

We were looking forward to seeing how it changed over the years. And it hasn't, the staff is great, professional but in the meantime very friendly, our waiters had fun with us. When my husband went to the bathroom our waiter joined me to keep me company and when we asked them to make a photo of us they even made a selfie of themselves, without us noticing. I only saw the picture at home while browsing through the photos. It was a very fun surprise!

The food is very special, although officially we only had a three-course lunch with the usual french small dessert surprise, we ended up getting a seven-course meal with all the surprise dishes. We already used to get some welcome bites in a high-end restaurant but here we got an additional appetizer and an extra dessert. And the bread they offer is very special, they have four different types -white, nuts, olives, cereal- and they serve it with some delicious olive oil from the region. Here is their current menu.  Sorry, it's in French, I couldn't find the English version.

We ended up trying everything and split all courses. We were very curious and wanted to taste everything! We found the appetizers the most elaborated. The surprise soup was extraordinary, beetroot soup with goat cheese cream. I love when they do something special from something ordinary and this dish was definitely the best beetroot soup I've ever eaten.
Since I have a sweet tooth my favourite was the dark chocolate cake, it was bitter and the middle was melting perfectly. 
I wish I could eat here more often. 

They are a bit pricey but if you look out for their offers during the offseason you might decide it's in your budget.

We were definitely full after all of this. Which is a very nice surprise in a Michelin star restaurant. I'd expect small portions but here everything was copious.

We continued our date with a nice stroll in the town and decided to sit down on the beach. It was nice to have some alone time with my husband. We love to spent time with Pixie but we needed this afternoon for us.
Honestly, I think he should take more days off and we should just do something fun together. We go on a lot's of holidays and usually don't waste any of his vacation days but after this afternoon I think it's a very good way of getting some rest and reconnecting.

When we went to pick up Pixie she was so surprised to see her dad, and she was so glad to walk home with us.
This was the first time we picked her up together. I always told my husband how difficult is to walk home with her, she gets always distracted and wants me to pick her up. I guess my hubby thought that I'm exaggerating but now he could see that it was true. It took us a lot of time to get home, although we had fun on the way at the end of the day sometimes we don't have the time to stop at every shop window and examine every little thing Pixie sees on the way. But this day was about spending time with each other and we had fun with Pixie showing daddy our way home and our usual stops.
This was definitely a day I'd like to repeat!
