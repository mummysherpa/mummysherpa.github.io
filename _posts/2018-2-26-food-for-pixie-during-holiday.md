header: "Pixie is very picky when it comes to food. If it would be up to her I think she would still only eat breastmilk and maybe some chocolate ☺ but it is not so I had to figure out what food is she willing to eat. It also changes from time to time. But I admit it was way easier when she was still only breastfeeding."

There is some food we know she will eat. She is always fine with yoghurt, pudding, crackers, bread and pizza. She likes mashed potatoes, plain pasta and rice. She loved sausages for a long period but now she is not that into it. Her new favourite is the omelette. 

I was a bit afraid what would happen during our trip if they would serve something that she would eat. I packed a few puddings so we wouldn't have to start by searching for a supermarket and I packed lots of crackers, dried raisins and muesli bars so she would have some snacks for the afternoons.

To my surprise, she ate more during the trip than at home. I think she liked that she could eat so much different food for dinner and breakfast. 

We realised during the trip that she likes omelette and scrambled eggs. She never really liked sandwiches but she liked the ham and cheese toasts, and plane pancakes. Luckily she didn't realise that you usually eat chocolate pancakes not just plain ones ☺

For dinner, she was eating pizza (ok I know it's not the best, but still I'm happy she eats something) french fries, plain pasta and she was willing to try some fish and chicken. And her favourite, of course, ice cream and chocolate mousse. 

We cannot avoid her eating some sweets but I'm trying really hard to limit them. But we decided that if we are eating something, she can get some as well. So I'm not allowed to have some dessert if I'm not willing to share it with her.

For lunch, we always tried to buy something she would like. But offering her only one option wasn't always the winner. We always had a banana with us as a fail safe. 

If your little one is a picky eater like Pixie you still can go on a holiday. You know your child, you know what she is willing to eat so you'd find something to offer her. Maybe they will start eating more because of the new options or don't. But for sure they won't starve themselves.
This shouldn't be an issue that would stop you from travelling.
