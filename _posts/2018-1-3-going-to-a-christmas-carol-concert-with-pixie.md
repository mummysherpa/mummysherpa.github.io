title: "Going to a Christmas Carol concert with Pixie"
date: 2018-1-2
header: "Every year there is a nice English Christmas Carol concert in our town. It's a charity event held for the Antibes lifeboat.
We always attend since we moved here. This year my husband had a company event the same time but I decided that I will try my luck and go alone with Pixie. I knew that our friends would attend as well so, we wouldn't be alone - alone. "

I was a bit afraid since it starts late and after the concert, they serve mulled wine and sausage, so I knew it will be defiantly past Pixie's bedtime by the time we get home. 

It was a success! I was so happy! We walked around the church before the start, and Pixie enjoyed the nativity scene and seeing all the people there. When the concert started I put her in the carrier. I hoped that she would be calm on me, and it worked! She was playing with her hat and the leaflet with the lyrics but she was generally quiet and didn't want to get out from the carrier.
She had so much fun with the singing! She even danced in the carrier.

To my surprise, as soon as it was her bedtime she started to search for her place on my chest and fall asleep. I thought she would have stayed up and listen to the concert, and try the sausage at the end but she was sleeping peacefully so mummy could chat with her friends â˜º

Putting her down when we got home was a bit tricky, I guess she was a bit confused but it was definitely worth it! I'm sure we'll go next year as well!
