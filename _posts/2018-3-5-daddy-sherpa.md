I was very curious to see how she will enjoy this. She is used to me carrying her everywhere and although my husband tried it a few times or we switched for short periods to get some rest, this was the first trip when solely my husband carried her.

To tell the truth, Pixie doesn't like it very much... she cries or moans for a few minutes, then she is sort of fine. But with me, she is almost always happy when she sees that I'm getting the carrier. She is so used to me, it's hard for her not to be on me.

The funniest, at least for me, when Pixie doesn't let my husband put his hand around her, which is quite complicated because sometimes if you sit down, or just want to rest your hand, your only option is to put it on your baby in the carrier.

My husband had to get used to walking hours with the extra weight on, but he was enjoying being so close to her daughter.

It's not easy to start carrying a 2-year-old toddler every day for longer hikes, but he managed. Sure it helped that he can carry a heavy backpack for an entire day without any issues but a wriggling toddler is more difficult.  He only carried Pixie for a longer time in our hiking carrier, but it distributes the weight better on his back.
 
Carrying a toddler can be challenging, but it worth it! Look at Pixie cuddling with her dad, they are so cute!

So if for any reason you are not able to carry your baby for a few days, don't be afraid to ask your husband for help. Sure it will be hard for him in the beginning but he will get used to it no time.
