header: "We recently took 3 flights with Pixie. I think they were easy ones compared to what I hear from other mums.
Since Pixie is a very curious little one she likes new places, new environment. An aircraft is a big toy for her. However, being restricted during takeoff and landing seems an issue."

Going through airport security isn't that complicated with a kid. You have priority, so you don't have to stand in the long line, you can go straight to the express lane. We are always prepared for the security check. I put every liquid into those little bags when packing, so I can just quickly put them in a tray, we usually only have Pixie's bottle filled with water, but you can also bring with you some baby food for the flight. We already know the rules, we can pack out everything fairly quickly.
The one thing which definitely helps at the airport is our baby carrier, we keep Pixie in it until we have to go through the metal detector, where you have to have your kid put from the carrier and just go through with her in your arms. 
At one airport she insisted on walking a bit on her own and not getting back in the carrier, which would be fine but it was a bit chaotic this time since we had to go through the duty-free shop which is not the ideal place for a toddler to run around â˜º 
As soon as I managed to convince Pixie to leave the shop we had fun taking the escalator up and down.

If you sit at the back of the plane, be careful if they offer you to board the plane from the front door. We accepted this offer which meant that I had to go through the people who boarded at the back to get to my seat. I don't know why they think it is easier to go through people than boarding at the rear entrance.

I still breastfeed during mornings and nights so for me it was obvious to try it during take off to relieve the pressure in Pixie's ears. It also made a bit easier for her to stay in my lap. She always wants to move around and was hard for her to stay in one place.

We were lucky because on 2 out of 3 flights we were sitting alone in the row so after take of if Pixie wanted she could have her own seat, which was definitely comfy for us!

She enjoyed looking out the window, checking under the seat, playing with the tray in front of her, looking through the magazines.

A 2-3 hour flight is not that difficult with a toddler as it seems. Next time she will have her own seat since she won't be an infant anymore. We'll see how will I manage to convince her to keep her seatbelt on.
