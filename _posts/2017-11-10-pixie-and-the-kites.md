We headed out after lunch so Pixie could have her afternoon nap in the car. She is being a bit difficult nowadays and doesn't want to nap but she is very tired by the end of the day so we try different tricks. One of them is the car ride, as most of the kids she falls asleep quite easy in the car so we try to plan our outings during her naptime.

My favourite kites were the big shaped ones floating in the air, we saw Krtek the little mole, bears, Jiminy Cricket and many more! Pixie was also curious, this was the first time she saw something so big flying above us. We saw a competition where they were flying the kites based on a choreography with music. It was interesting however I found more fascinating when there were multiple kites dancing in synchrony.

It is usually a two day event but watch out for the weather forecast because although kites need wind but the second day was cancelled this year dur to strong winds. We were lucky that we went there on Saturday and had a chance to admire the festival.

They had lots of animations for bigger kids, many arts and crafts stalls where they were able to create and decorate their own kites. There were also some food stalls and a few concerts throughout the day. It was a perfect family event. 

As our usual stop we went with Pixie to the playground, to be honest she might enjoyed that more than the kites! She loves to discover new places, she cautiously observes other kids playing and after a few minutes she tries to join the fun.

We walked around a bit more and when we felt that we saw everything we decided to head home taking the scenic road by the beach. It definitely takes longer but the view is amazing, the red mountains of Esterel the little rocky beaches. This is my husbands favourite road to drive on.
