I always wanted to try this out with Pixie but I thought she wasn't old enough. You need to stimulate your 6 months old, but maybe a reading session is not the most exciting thing for them.

Now that she speaks some French it was time to try it. I tried to sign up a few times but they were always full. You can sign up one month prior the session, it's worth calling on that day because the list gets full quite fast. 

I already have the next sign-up date in my calendar to get into another session.

It's held by two of the libertarians, and they were super nice with the kids. There is a separate room for the sessions, it's nicely decorated with toys, kids books, there are cushions for the kids to sit on. There is plenty of space in the library to leave your pushchair because it's held outside normal working hours.

The session starts at 10 am which is a perfect time for Pixie. She is still very active and attentive, not yet tired from other morning activities and we can get easily home after the session for lunch time, we even have time for a nice stroll in town.

The first time when we went to the reading session the topic was "going to sleep".  They had many books picked out and they read us cute stories about how to get ready for bed or what happens to bad kids who don't want to fall asleep. We listened to music and there were a few songs as well that they are singing at every session, so kids can learn it and join the fun. 

All the other kids were sitting calmly, Pixie was so curious she wanted to explore the room and rearrange all the cushions. But this was fine, it is organised for kids and they know not all of them can sit through half an hour. Definitely, Pixie is not there yet! But she enjoyed the session and we'll go back as much as we can.

She enjoyed the singing, and I hope she understood some of the stories. I actually don't know how much French she understands and stories for little kids are sometimes written in a very difficult language. But at least she can listen to some nice French tales.

If you have anything like this in your area I would definitely recommend it to all kids. Even Pixie who just started learning French had fun.
