At what age should you take your kid to a zoo to a play center to the beach? I never knew.. so I opted for the trial or error.
I took her quite early, when she was still crawling, to the playground and she loved it! She enjoyed climbing on the toys, observing other kids. True, she needed my help quite often but we had a blast!

You'd think that she enjoys those activities where she can run around and doesn't need to stay still. Yes, the threat is not yet for her, but she can just observe a construction site and she looks like a statue, she just watches all the diggers and cranes and she is fascinated by all the movement. I guess she is a bit afraid of all the big machines and she doesn't dear to approach them, she is just carefully keeping an eye on things from a safe distance. 

Last week's challenge was to take her trick or treating or to stay at home. I love Halloween, I think it is a fun tradition for kids to dress up go out and collect some candies. Of course, Pixie is too small to comprehend what's going on but when I dressed her up at home and I put on my costume as well she was having fun. I put up my hair and had some nice pins in it and she demanded some as well. She was running around the flat, showing off her new outfit. 
So I decided to join some other mums with bigger kids and go into the old town and try how trick or treating works in France.

Pixie is very curious, she likes to try out new things. I decided that I rather take her to new activities and decide along the way if she is having fun or not. I never try to take her to a very elegant restaurant or a theatre intended for adults. But anywhere where she is welcomed we are ready to try. So far this tactic was a success. She had fun in museums, beer festival, cafes etc...
