Do we always think it will get easier when kids get a bit older?

I used to think having a newborn is super difficult, being a first time mum it definitely seemed so. Looking back, maybe that was the easiest period from the last 4,5 years. 
Pixie used to sleep so well when she was a baby, 4 hours after feedings, yes in the beginning I had to get up for night feedings, but when she fell asleep I could put her back to her cot, and then she started to sleep through the night (ok, only until she was 6 months old and she realised she can demand some attention during the night as well)
But it was so easy to carry a newborn, she was only 3kilos and now she is 18kgs and she still asks us to carry her time to time. 
I was able to go anywhere with a baby, it was easy, I needed a nappy bag and a carrier,  she had instant access to her food ðŸ˜Š and she could nap anytime she wanted on my chest.
Now they want to bring their favourite toys, different snacks, water, of course we are not able to walk as much with Pixie and we just started to skip the afternoon naptime which meant that we had to be home for 2 hours during the afternoon. 

On the other hand she is already 4,5 and I'm able to sit in a cafÃ© with her, have a mummy daughter morning, pop in a shop with her, she isn't trying to run away anymore. If I tell her to stay where I can see her, she knows not to go far away. She knows how to communicate now, so if she wants a red cup instead of a blue one in a restaurant she won't have an instant meltdown that you have to manage, she just tells me what she wants and that's so much easier. 

But managing the two kids together it's still difficult, Manny who is only 2 won't have the same needs and abilities as his sister. When he sees her walking he doesn't want to be carried but of course he's not yet able to walk a lot or fast. So it takes so much time to get from A to B. 
And there's the brother sister rivalry, they always want what the other has, which is not so easy to manage when we are out. Although I think this will never get easier ðŸ˜ƒ but at least maybe Manny will stop screaming and I will be able to negotiate something with them when he will comprehend the situation better.

Do I think it will be easier when they will be a bit older, no! I think there will be new challenges that I need to handle.
