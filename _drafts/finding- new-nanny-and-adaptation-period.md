Finding a new nanny and adaptation period

Manny had a nanny (Assistant Maternell ) for 6 months but he stopped going last December.

So after confinement we started searching for a new one who might be a better fit for us.

I really wanted someone close to our home and Pixie's school so I shouldn't have to rush back and forth between places.
We only did two interviews and we were extremely lucky. We found someone wonderful!
She is very patient with kids, she is so kind with them! She fit all of our criteria, close to us, I can drop Manny off after school drop off and pick him up in the afternoon and we walk together to Pixie's school to meet her by the gate. She accepted us for only two days per week, and believe me it's so hard to find someone who takes kids part time.


We had a very slow adaptation period, first day I stayed all morning with Manny and we went home before lunch time. 
Second day I stayed again for the morning, and we ate lunch there but went home for lunchtime. 
The third day I left for a bit during the morning and just went back by the end of lunch and I stayed during his naptime.

Manny really enjoyed his days but he started to realise that I won't stay there every time and separation became more and more difficult so we decided that I better just stay a few minutes and leave him there all day.
And it worked, he still cries a but when I leave but as soon as close the door he stops. He just really doesn't like to say goodbye to mummy. Cutie little boy!

After the first day he spent there alone he was so happy to show me all the toys he played with. He had do redo all the puzzles, take out all toys ☺️ 
Now, after a few weeks, he just shows me his drawing he did that they and shows me I need to put it away. When we get to the school he proudly shows it to his big sister!
They go for a walk each day, they check out the ducks who live nearby or take some toys to the beach amd play there. 
The nanny reads him stories in French and she tries to teach him a few words. It's perfect ☺️!

He asks me every morning if he is going to the nanny that day and he becomes sad when my answer is no. So I guess we found his new nanny!!
