Something's cooking in the kitchen

So it's time to get ready for the new school year.
Pixie will start second year of kindergarten, it's called middle section here. We'll get a small shopping list in September but we already have to tasks. She will need a sunlounger mattress for naptime, it was a bit hard to find a smaller version as requested by the school but we managed. 
The second task however is a big challenge. The 3 different sections are divided into colours, yellow for the small kids ,like little yellow chicks, the middle section is green and the big one is blue. These colours all depend on schools, and the kids are required to wear a cape over their clothes in the appropriate colour. 
You would think that an entire industry would be built around this. And yes, there are some companies who sell only these capes, my issue is with the green colour. I can only find the ones that are sold by the big supermarkets, and these are 60% polyester, so I'm not a huge fan. I managed to find one company who sells very light mint colour... Yes, it's still green but who knows if the teacher would accept that... So my mission continued.
Most kids clothing shops come out with a new design, colour every year but who knows why they usually start to sell it in September when school has started already, and you never know if the colours will fit into your needs. Last year our favourite shop was selling yellow and blue ones only but in previous years they were red and blue. So it will be a surprise.

After several hours spent browsing I gave up and had an other idea.
She had a lovely yellow one last year which was 100% cotton, so why not paint it. I was looking for the type of dye you put in the washing machine and it does the job for you, but I didn't manage to find a green one at a decent price. I managed to find tie dye in various green colours. 
I didn't want to choose a light green one, was a bit affraid that the original yellow colour would have an effect on outcome so I ended up with "russian green". 
It's pretty easy to paint textile with it. You just dissolve the paint powder in boiling water with salt, let it cool a bit, then put in the textile and leave it soaking for 30-60 minutes depending on the colour you want to reach. 

I'm very happy with the outcome, it looks great. The material had these cute printed white hearts all over which survived the heat, so Pixie was glad she will have her favourite cape again just in green.
