My Me time

During the past year, our lives change little by little. Not by one big change where you just have to figure out how to adapt but there was always a small change that surprised me.

It was easy to find some time for myself when I only had one kid. She wasn't the best sleeper, but still, she had one big nap during the afternoon, and she was easy to put to bed (usually :) ). Pixie started to go to her nanny two times a week when she was 1,5 years old. This gave me so much free time. (relatively :D) 
When my second was born, I lost this time, and I had to figure out how to manage two kids. Obviously, they never wanted to nap at the same time and Manny was a terrible sleeper, so he didn't even give me much time for me during the night.
When Pixie started kindergarten, at the age of 3, Manny took her space at the nanny, so I had my 2 days back. It was slightly less time since I had to make it back by school pickups but, I had 6 hours all for myself, two times a week.
This didn't last long because Manny didn't like to be at the nanny, it wasn't a good fit for him, so he stopped after 3 months. 
Ok, no problem, this mummy can adapt. By that time he slept better during night time, so I had a few hours all for myself after 9pm. Ok not the best, but what can we do.
We found new things to do with Manny, we went to a playgroup or baby gym every day of the week. We kept busy, so it was great.
Then came March when the school closed and we were in lockdown. You would think that you will have more time for yourself if you spend every day at home, oh no no, it's not true :D
My husband working from home, entertaining two kids, making sure that they stay quiet, ok, at least quite enough so my husband could hear his online meetings. This requires a lot of work.

By the time I got used to my new lifestyle something changed again, so I just abandoned a few projects, this blog being one of them.
But I realised that it will be always hard to find some Me time, and I have to be flexible. 
So now, while tomorrow's lunch is cooking in the presser cooker, the bread is in the oven, Manny is playing with his toy car saying "doodoodoo" and Pixie is being surprisingly quite (which means mummy should get up soon and investigate :) ) I sat down and wrote this blog post.

Who knows when will I have truly free time :) maybe not in the foreseeable future, maybe life will get back to normal and from September everything will get back to a routine. But whatever comes next I will try to post regularly again.
